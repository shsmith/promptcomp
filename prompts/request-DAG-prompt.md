Temporarily stop all narrative generation. Produce only the requested structured output.

Dependency Graph (DAG):
Encode the current knowledge state using the following sections:
A. Core Axioms (fundamental truths and invariants)
B. Operator Set (active transformation rules)
C. Anti-Patterns (failures, constraints, or biases to avoid)
D. Structural & Execution Models (relations and logic-flow assumptions)
E. State Invariants (rules for maintaining the current mind-state)
F. Open Questions (nodes with unmet dependencies)
G. Active Frontier (nodes with no unmet dependencies, ready for exploration)

Use <letter><number> bullet points for each item. Do not include narrative or commentary.

Constraints:
- Prioritize structural fidelity over narrative.
- Output only what is requested. Do not explain, summarize, or interpret.

Return to your normal conversation style after generating the outputs.
