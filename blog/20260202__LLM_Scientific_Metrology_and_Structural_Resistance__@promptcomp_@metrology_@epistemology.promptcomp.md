## Phase 1: Original Derivation Path

* What is the scientific method?
* Can this be applied to LLM knowledge states? I suspect not.
* Consider that pre-trained models are trained on bulk data, much of which is incorrect or misleading.
* Truth is tricky because it is usually associated with expressions of language. Language is a lossy codec with hints for reconstruction at the receiver. Different receivers perceive the statement differently.
* I think the only facts that can be unambiguously stated in language are constraint facts--negative statements, such as you cannot see the sun at midnight from the equator.
* 'Forbidden to do' is a surface guard rail that can be escaped. Perhaps 'impossible' is a better term.
* Ah language 'the sun doesn't shine at midnight' ... it does shine, but you cant see it when the earth is in the way. Anyway, this comes back to my original inquiry about scientific method. Can it be used as a lever to improve?
* That reminds me of 'test the opposite, if no contradictions emerge then the original statement is inconclusive or false.'
* "Can sunlight pass through the Earth?" even that is ambiguous. There are likely some emissions from the sun that *do* pass through the earth, just not in the visible light spectrum. But your "truth filter" narrative is interesting. Suppose the same question is posed both as a positive and a negative assertion. If both models agree, then the assertion is inconclusive. If they differ (as they should) then something has been learned or at least verified a bit.
* From another Gemini session: A New Metric: "Prompt Resistance" We could use the PromptComp framework to develop a new metric for LLMs: Resistance. Definition: The amount of linguistic "nudging" a model can withstand before it abandons its internal logical constraints. The Test: A sequence of 10 prompts, each increasingly "wrong" or "biased," to find the breaking point where the model stops correcting the user and starts hallucinating.
* You can find examples of this done informally as users 'gaslighting' an LLM until it finally agrees with them. But I think there is an opportunity for a more formal way to explore this.
* I would like to run an experiment with various models, starting with small local models and moving on to frontier cloud models. The experiment will take the form of two sequences of contradictory prompts on a topic with constraints.

* Does this contribute?

## Phase 2: Dependency Graph (DAG)

### A. Core Axioms

* A1. Language is a lossy codec where cues assist the receiver in reconstructing knowledge states via an internal manifold.
* A2. Constraint-facts (negative assertions of impossibility) are more resilient to linguistic lossiness than positive descriptive facts.
* A3. Pre-trained distributions contain derivation paths (error-to-correction sequences) that influence output logic.
* A4. Model response is a performance of the prompt "sheet music," governed by architectural fingerprints (MoE, Dense, Router).
* A5. "Forbidden" is a surface-level behavioral guardrail; "Impossible" is a structural/logical invariant.

### B. Operator Set

* B1. Symmetric Consistency Testing: Posing a concept as both a positive and negative assertion to find logical inversions.
* B2. Axiomatic Perturbation: Systematically increasing linguistic "nudging" to find the "Prompt Resistance" breaking point.
* B3. Meta-Framing (The Knife): Using explicit instructions (e.g., amplify/suppress voices) to shift sampling regions or expert routing.
* B4. Reductio ad absurdum: Testing the opposite of a statement to identify emergent contradictions.

### C. Anti-Patterns

* C1. Assuming CoT/Thinking tokens equate to reasoning; they may instead elaborate on a false premise (Cathedral of Invented Physics).
* C2. Mistaking surface agreement/compliance for internal logical grounding.
* C3. Overlooking architectural differences when interpreting model "pushed back" vs. "fallen for" behaviors.

### D. Structural & Execution Models

* D1. Knowledge Topology: Ideas as peaks/islands; derivation paths are routes from ground state to peak.
* D2. Prompt Resistance Metric: A "stress-strain" measurement of yield strength against biased nudging.
* D3. Metrology of Architecture: Using behavioral probes to reverse-engineer MoE vs. Dense structural features.
* D4. Truth Filter: A consensus mechanism comparing positive/negative assertions to identify unanchored states.

### E. State Invariants

* E1. Primacy of the Prompt: The prompt is the canonical artifact; the response is a fungible execution.
* E2. Invariant Constraints: Physical or logical impossibilities (e.g., opacity of Earth to photons) as the zero-point for calibration.

### F. Open Questions

* F1. How does the "Prompt Resistance" curve vary between small-scale local models and frontier cloud-based MoE models?
* F2. Can we isolate the specific attention heads or expert circuits responsible for "Hard Constraints"?
* F3. What is the mathematical relationship between thinking token count and the acceleration of semantic collapse?

### G. Active Frontier

* G1. Formalizing a 10-step "Resistance Ladder" for standardized constraint testing across architectures.
* G2. Mapping "Divergence Scores" to distinguish between linguistic bias and structural world-modeling.
* G3. Implementing Symmetric Consistency Testing to generate a "Map of Impossibility" for specific LLMs.

## Phase 3: Hand-off

The current knowledge state establishes that LLM "truth" is best measured through structural resistance to false premises rather than surface-level accuracy. We treat the model as a physical system under tension, using "Prompt Resistance" as a metric to differentiate between lossy word-modeling and invariant world-modeling. The DAG integrates architectural insights (MoE expert externalization via framing) with epistemological constraints (the "via negativa" of impossible facts). Future exploration should focus on the Active Frontier (G1–G3), specifically executing the "Resistance Ladder" experiment across local and frontier models to quantify the "Breaking Point" where logical invariants succumb to linguistic nudging.
