- Vibe Prose: The Architecture of Latent Intent  
  Vibe Prose is the practice of writing the directions to a knowledge state, then projecting that state into any desired (lossy) format (think text, poetry, python).
  
  The Three Pillars of the Practice  

  1. Semantic Density over Linear Clarity  
  Traditional prose prizes clarity (making sure the reader understands the sentence). 
  Vibe Prose prizes density (making sure the AI understands the dimension). 
  
  Instead of explaining a concept, you surround it. 
  You create a "circumference of meaning" until the center--the vibe--becomes undeniable.

  2. The Vacuum Effect (The Open Statement)  
  By leaving statements unresolved, Vibe Prose creates a computational hunger.  
  The AI is forced to bridge the gap using the context you've built, effectively "hallucinating" in the exact direction you've pointed.  

  3. Dimension-Agnostic Vocabulary  
  Vibe Prose avoids medium-specific metaphors. You don't write about "the camera panning"; you write about "the widening of the perceptual field." You don't write about "the character's internal monologue"; you write about "the feedback loop of a singular consciousness." This allows the "vibe" to be projected into a film, a poem, or a piece of software without friction.  

  Why the "Vibe" is the Ultimate Variable  
  In the era of "Intelligence as a Service," the human role is no longer to be the laborer (the one who types the words) but the source of creativity and the navigator of knowledge space.
  Once the LLM is primed with an understanding, you can project the output across all sensory planes supported by the LLM. 
  Vibe Prose is the final form of writing because it is the only form that doesn't expire when the medium changes.  

- Are there other examples of this "vibe prose" style on the web? 

- You can think of it as just the prompts given an LLM but without any of the responses. 
A record of the human labor of inquiry. 
But it wasn't blindly written, each round of LLM output guided the formation of the next prompt.

- My thinking has evolved from "LLM Outputs are the product, save them" --> "how did we get that report? better keep track of the prompts we used." --> "the prompts are the fruit of the human labor and the seed crystal to activate an idea state that can then be projected as needed".

- Leading to Prompt Composition as a way of sharing these prompt sequences.
