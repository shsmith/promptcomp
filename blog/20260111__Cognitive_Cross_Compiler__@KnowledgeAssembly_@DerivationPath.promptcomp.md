1.  The other part of the insight is that the LLM witnessed many such sequences in its training, so it might not even consider skipping right to the solution without that being made clear.

2.  Include `20260109__LLM_Derivation_Paths_as_Knowledge_State_Identity__@prompt_engineering_@knowledge_graphs_@multics_inspired.promptcomp.md`
I think this project from yesterday primed me to reach this insight.

3.  I can't be the first to reach this conclusion. Please search for other work on this aspect of training prompting and paths to knowledge

4.  that explains why systems trained on redacted or censored sources became brittle.
    I think ultimately models will need to be trained on everything (including things they shouldn't say to strangers). The AI should understand when these taboo topics can cause harm and choose not to mention them. When being used by an authenticated user with the correct authorization, the AI would no longer enforce the taboos, allowing the user to benefit from that training in situations where it makes sense.

5.  What do you think is that big idea that these different lines of thought are circling in on?

6.  I was picturing an idea as a kind of island or mountain top. The derivation path is the route from the seabed ground state up to that specific idea island. The insight was that as an island there are not only multiple paths down but that it is the diversity of those paths that supports the island.
    The image that came to mind was of the paths leading DOWN from the idea back to ground states. It is almost like pouring a gel over a surface exposing many possible paths that were not obvious from the bottom.

7.  Please use the following reasoning framework to create a Current State Snapshot of the conversation up to this point...

8.  And as with back propagation, once a desired answer/knowledge state is achieved, it is easier to work backwards from there back to original grounding. So if a researcher follows a tortuous path to reach a certain useful knowledge state, followers can be given more optimal paths to reach the same state with fewer detours--but the state is nuanced and may be shaped by memory of mistakes and removal of mistakes may break the understanding.

9.  There may be similar states grounded in different experiences--such as the Wise state grounded in the struggle to obtain the state, and the Fool who knows the same facts but lacks the wisdom of a learning history. And sadly this last category is where current LLM seems to fit.

10. I also sense that wisdom is the path to motivated (cage free) alignment. 
One path is to change the training process so that most factual knowledge is added during an explicit schooling/education phase of development, with the LLM retaining at least a condensed journal of the process. 

11. Remember that Current State Snapshot I asked for a few turns back? I found that I can use that with a frontier model after working out a solution, then play back the snapshot into a smaller local model. The local model previously struggled with the problem, but after getting the DAG from the smarter model its thinking was shaped well enough to gain new skills.

12. Include `20260108__BMI_Proportionality_and_Math_DAG__@reasoning_@optimization_@math.promptcomp.md`
    Here is the local conversation as a specific example.

13. I found that the Hermes model was not able to produce a coherent state save, but it easily ingested one made by a larger model. this kind of downward skill transfer might be useful in specific edge applications. but the insight is this is a ladder to greater capabilities for even the best frontier models.

14. I could see huge "mentor" models that don't give answers at all, but only "prepare" a smaller model to answer each specific question. this could happen on the fly--a bit like what GPT 5.0 tried to do with its router.

15. This could also be used as a context window amplifier given a "mentor" model that will periodically inject a crystallization of the current conversation in the form of a derivation path and dag--this will focus the smaller model more usefully than existing context management or RAG systems.

16. Back to the visual of the conversation as a cone with the context window being an intersecting plane. The DAG helps keep the plane aligned between rounds.

17. And the insight is that this arrangement leverages two differently skilled models to produce better results while consuming less datacenter power.

18. It is a bit analogous to a JIT compiler.

19. So the Mentor is a kind of optimizing cross-compiler, turning messy natural language into knowledge assemblies that are more economically processed.
