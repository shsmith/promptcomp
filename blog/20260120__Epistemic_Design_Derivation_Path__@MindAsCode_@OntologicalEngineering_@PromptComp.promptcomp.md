Let’s consider a less lofty objective. 
Can we use these derivation path concepts as a way of quickly re-creating a conversation context in a new LLM chat when the previous one has reached some size limit or usage cap or was brought through some guard rail?

This could be used to design a student notetaking process for use during the classroom or any other learning experience?

That made me wonder are there certain thoughts or ideas that cannot be expressed or reached by means of a Socratic dialogue. And how does a Socratic dialogue compare to a derivation path?

What would you call this line of inquiry? Is it philosophy or engineering or something else?

You could picture each stage in the derivation path as 
a function 
which takes as its input the derivation up to this point 
and applies specific neural operations to modify the state. 

And there may be a fairly small number of these possible neural operations if we could enumerate them, it might shed some light on why certain things work better than other things and how to make the best use of the technology we have access to.

Humans are plagued by misinterpreting or having pre-judged values without any actual evidence or by framing that occurred prior to a particular incident so some of these operators are anti-pattern operators to be removed during optimization.
